# Light-Sim-Snell
This Program takes a input as theta 1 and outputs a value that it renders using tkinter. By using SnellÂ´s law, the program calculates the angle of refraction. This program has gone through multiply versions with the earliest using turtle graphics and the later versions running on tkinter.
